# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana organize the data in a manner that is easy to locate specific features such as Date, City, State and shape seen during the UFO sighting.
To help Dana achieve her goals we create easy to use filters so Dana and other users can search the data hassle-free.

As you can see there are 5 different filters (Date, City, State, Country, Shape) you can choose to fill out. The user can decide to fill out 1 or more to get more specific information to filter your data.

I have filled out the filter "City" with el cajon. This has returned all UFO sightings in this database for el cajon.

## Summary
One drawback of this design is you are not able to select multiple cities at once. Therefore, I am not allowed to look at UFO sightings from "benton" and "el cajon" at once if wanted to compare for correlations.

Two recommendations I have for further development are a "clear filters" button so it does not need to be erased manually and the option to fill out 2 or more inputs for the filter.
